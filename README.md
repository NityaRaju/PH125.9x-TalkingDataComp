# PH125.9x-TalkingDataComp
Capstone project for Harvards Data Science professional certification

Dataset for this Kaggle competition can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection/data

I have also uploaded it to my google drive for graders to access: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lc5Xdskz6C-XNAt9LJv7tXm81dRVkGpy?usp=sharing

I was unable to upload the large dataset to github(even zip file was too large), I tried using github large file storage and I'm sure I'd be able to figure it out given more time, but the deadline for the project is very soon and I have not found a way to include the dataset using my GitHub repo. Link to google drive should give same access. Apologies for inconvenience.
